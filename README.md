# Space Missions Exploration

## Description
The project is the **Exploratory Data Analysis** (EDA) of all **Space Missions** from **1957** to **2020**.
<hr>

## Additional details
* There are two jupyter notebooks in the project: [space-missions.ipynb](https://github.com/sagar-0817/space-missions/blob/master/space-missions.ipynb) 
and [plotly-instructions.ipynb](https://github.com/sagar-0817/space-missions/blob/master/plotly-instructions.ipynb).<br>
* [space-missions.ipynb](https://github.com/sagar-0817/space-missions/blob/master/space-missions.ipynb) is the main notebook in which the EDA has been done.<br>
* [plotly-instructions.ipynb](https://github.com/sagar-0817/space-missions/blob/master/plotly-instructions.ipynb) gives instructions on how to interact
with the graphs plotted in main notebook.<br>
* Additionally, there is also a dataset which is used in the main notebook called 
[space_missions.csv](https://github.com/sagar-0817/space-missions/blob/master/space_missions.csv).<br>
<hr>

## Running the notebooks in local system
* A few libraries has to be installed in order to run the notebooks in your local system.<br>
* Libraries required to run the notebooks are mentioned in [requirements.txt](https://github.com/sagar-0817/space-missions/blob/master/requirements.txt).

## Note
* Since plotly graphs are interactive and Github performs a static render of the notebooks, the graphs do not appear when the notebooks are viewed on GitHub.<br>
* You will be able to view the graphs when the notebooks are rendered on [jupyter nbviewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/). All you have to do is go to the link,
copy and paste any of the following URLs and click `Go!`.

  * **plotly-instructions.ipynb** : https://github.com/sagar-0817/space-missions/blob/master/plotly-instructions.ipynb<br>
  
* You can also view the notebooks on [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com) where you can run the notebooks and make changes if you want without downloading
the notebooks to your local system.
