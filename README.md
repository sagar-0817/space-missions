# Space Missions Exploration

## Description
* The project is the **Data Analysis** of all **Space Missions** from **1957** to **2020**.<br>
* The **insights** of the **Space Missions** have been visually expressed through **interactive graphs/charts**.
<hr>

## Additional details
* There is one jupyter notebook in the project [space-missions.ipynb](https://github.com/sagar-0817/space-missions/blob/master/space-missions.ipynb) in which the Data Analysis has been done.<br>
* The notebook uses a dataset called [space_missions.csv](https://github.com/sagar-0817/space-missions/blob/master/space_missions.csv).<br>
* To understand how to interact with the different plotly graphs, you can view [this](https://github.com/sagar-0817/plotly-graph-instructions/blob/master/plotly-graph-instructions.ipynb) notebook.
<hr>

## Running the notebook in local system
* A few libraries has to be installed in order to run the notebook in your local system.<br>
* Libraries required to run the notebook are mentioned in [requirements.txt](https://github.com/sagar-0817/space-missions/blob/master/requirements.txt).

## Note
* Since plotly graphs are interactive and Github performs a static render of the notebook, the graphs do not appear when the notebook is viewed on GitHub.<br>
* You will be able to view the graphs when the notebook is rendered on [jupyter nbviewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/). All you have to do is go to the link,
copy and paste the following URL and click `Go!`.
  * **space-missions.ipynb** : https://github.com/sagar-0817/space-missions/blob/master/space-missions.ipynb
  
* You can also view the notebook on [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com) where you can run the notebook and make changes if you want without downloading
the notebook to your local system.
